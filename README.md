# Assignment

1. Understand the importance of software testing in software development.
2. Differentiate between key testing concepts such as errors, defects, and failures.
3. Learn software testing principles, including the "Pesticide Paradox."
4. Explore different types of testing methodologies: static vs. dynamic testing.
5. Recognize the impact of early testing in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Answer 1

1. It helps identifies defect on time before the software is deployed.
2. It enhances the quality of the software which makes it to perform well.
3. It helps build the confidence in stakeholder.

## Answer 2

1. Error: This is a mistake done by the programmer.
2. Defect: A flaw in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly.
3. Failure: This is the inability for the software to perform it intended functions.

## Answer 3

1. Testing shows presence of defects.
2. Exhaustive testing is not possible.
3. Early Testing.
4. Defect Clustering.
5. Pesticde Paradox
6. Testing is Context-Dependent
7. Absence of Errors Fallacy

## Answer 4

Static testing involves reviewing of code or documentation without running of the software while Dynamic testing involves executing the code and checking of its behaviour during runtime.

## Answer 5

1. Requirement Analysis: Ensures that all requirements are clear and testable, reducing ambiguity.
2. Test Planning: Establishes a structured approach to testing, ensuring resources are allocated effectively.
3. Test Design: Creates detailed test cases that guide testers in executing tests systematically.
4. Test Environment Setup: Ensures a stable environment for accurate testing results.
5. Test Execution: Identifies defects early in the process, allowing for timely fixes.
6. Defect Reporting: Facilitates communication between testers and developers to ensure issues are addressed.
7. Test Closure: Provides insights into the testing process and highlights areas for improvement in future projects.
